ActiveCampaign has been committed to developers from the very beginning. They built their REST API 3-5 years ago to begin fostering a developer community and since then they've grown their platform to the point where load from API polling would sometimes disrupt service.

About a year ago, ActiveCampaign implemented REST hooks. Their server load has been reduced and they get fewer support tickets regarding polling.

Let's take a look at how exactly ActiveCampaign uses REST hooks.

## REST Hooks

ActiveCampaign's REST API supports several methods for interacting with webhooks. They offer an endpoint to create, list, delete, and review specific hooks. Hooks can be triggered <a href="http://www.activecampaign.com/api/webhooks.php">by several things</a> including:

1. Changes to a contact (subscribe, bounce, etc.)
2. Changes by an admin user (adding a contact manually)
3. Events by the system (automated emails, etc.)
4. Events through the API (adding a contact via the API)

## Fat Payloads

ActiveCampaign sends all their hooks over the wire with full API responses, meaning you do not need to perform another API call in order to get usable data.

## Retries

While ActiveCampaign's API does not retry failed hooks, they will store a delivered status which you can request specifically by hitting their hook list endpoint. This could be used to periodically verify you've received all hooks or to access old hooks.

## Inline Unsubscribe

If your hook endpoint returns a `410` response, then ActiveCampaign will automatically delete and clean-up the hook for you.
