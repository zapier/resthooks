Formstack built their original API when their product launched but adoption was so-so and lots of developers were hitting rate-limits.

While refreshing their API to be more usable about a year ago, the Formstack team made sure to include REST Hooks support. Not only did it provide a much better user experience for those consuming the API, but it also gave an outlet for users demanding more integrations.

Even better, after adopting REST Hooks they saw a significant drop in the amount of server resources needed to power their API, giving them improved performance to go with the improved user experience.

Let's take a look at how exactly Formstack uses REST hooks.

## REST Hooks

Formstack is a classic example of REST hooks. They have a REST componenet to subscibe, access and unsubscribe from hooks. Addionally, they offer many toggles which can be used to make REST hooks more secure from the receiver's point of view.

## Identity Verification

Formstack uses a handshake key to identify they are a verified sender. This handshake key is set up specified by the receiver when the subscription is set up for the first time.

## Skinny Payloads

Formstack requires you to specify wether you'd like skinny or fat payloads when you subscribe to receive hooks. You can send along a true of false value for `append_data` when subscribing.
